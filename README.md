# CPP Labsheet
Includes solution of DS Baral C++ Labsheets

## LabSheet 3
* Question_1
<br>Uses concept of class and objects to converts temperature from celsius to kelvin and vice-versa
* Question_2
<br>Program that asks for numbers repeatedly and checks whether it is prime or not using the concept of classes and objects
* Question_3
<br>Program that sets and gets data members using functions within the classes
* Question_4
<br>Program to calculate the area and perimeter of circle, triangle and rectangle and display it using classes
* Question_5
<br>Program that passes the arguments like employee ID, total bonus and total overtime in a particular year of the employee and display it using classes

## LabSheet 4
* Question_1
<br>Program that adds two time objects and display it in 12 as well as 24 hour format
* Question_2
<br>Program that concatenates to arrays of character using new and delete operator for memory allocation and deallocation
* Question_3
<br>Program showing the order of constructor and destructor invocation
* Question_4
<br>Program that show a bit-by-bit copy of one object to another (using copy constructor) and give 10% discount on charge if num_vehicle is greater than 10
* Question_5
<br>Program illustrating the relationship between:  (i)const_obj.non_const_mem_function  (ii)const_obj.const_mem_function  (iii)non_const_obj.non_const_mem_function  (iv)non_const_obj.const_mem_function
* Question_6
<br>Program that holds the serial number for each object created from the class and shows it using static function

## LabSheet 5
* Question_1
<br>Program demonstrating that all the member functions of one class are the friend functions of another class if the former class is made friend to the latter.
* Question_2
<br> Overloading addition and subtraction operators for addition and subtraction of two coordinate objects(Using non-member functions)
* Question_3
<br>Program to compare two objects of a class to overload equality(==), less than(<), greater than(>), not equal (!=), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to(<=) operators using member operator functions.
